The University of Minnesota Cycling Team is pleased to announce the 2014 Spring Break team trip! We will be traveling to Saint Louis, MO; Fayetteville, AR; and Lincoln, NE to participate in two race weekends and our annual training camp. The trip is open to all UMCT members and will cost $350.

This year's trip kicks off on March 14, 2014 with the team's departure from Minneapolis throughout the day. We will travel to Saint Louis, MO, to participate in the Lindenwood University Road Extravaganza, a dual-conference event between the [NCCCC](http://nc-cycling.com) and the [MWCCC](http://mwccc.org), on March 15 and 16. From there we will head south to Fayetteville, AR, to spend the week training in (hopefully) warmer weather. At the end of the week we will then head to Lincoln, NE, to participate in a second race weekend, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Tour De Husker.

We will be posting updates throughout the trip here on UMCT.org as well as on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/UofMCycling) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uofmcycling).
